Images in HTML
    Replaced elements: 
        In CSS, a replaced element is an element whose representation is outside the scope of CSS; 
        they're external objects whose representation is independent of the CSS formatting model.

            But if the image isn't being displayed, for example, the user has just navigated to the page, 
            and the image hasn't yet loaded, you'll notice the browser is leaving a space for the image to appear in
